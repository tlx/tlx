/*!
 * MultiTimer can be used to measure time usage of different phases in a program
 * or algorithm. It contains multiple named "timers", which can be activated
 * without prior definition. At most one timer is start at any time, which
 * means `start()` will stop any current timer and start a new one.
 *
 * Timers are identified by strings, which are passed as const char*, which MUST
 * remain valid for the lifetime of the MultiTimer. Dynamic strings will not
 * work, the standard way is to use plain string literals. The strings are hash
 * for faster searches.
 *
 * MultiTimer can also be used for multi-threading parallel programs. Each
 * thread must create and keep its own MultiTimer instance, which can then be
 * added together into a global MultiTimer object. The add() method of the
 * global object is internally thread-safe using a global mutex.
